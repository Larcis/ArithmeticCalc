# ArithmeticCalc
This code calculates expressions like   
  a = 3 ;  
  b = 2 ;  
  c = a + b * 4 ;  
  b = c + b * 2 ;  
  d = a * ( b â€“ c ) / 2 ;   
and respectivly assign variables then use them in next expressions. 
  
To use this code first you must create a txt file which name is input.txt.  
  
Then you must write expression with one space after each variable, 
operation and immediate value.   
  
Each expression must be in one line. 
  
Variable names must be one length ,  a-z , lower case only.
